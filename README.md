# COVID-CDC-DATASET-FOR-HOSPITLISATION-PREDICTION
COVID-19 Case Surveillance -US-CDC DATASET- Predictors for Hospitlisations
INTRODUCTION:
Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on almost every aspect of our life. Compared to other viruses it was not the most lethal or more virulent but it's rapid transmission and adverse effects on certain population groups increased the need for hospitlisation in a large number of population in a short period of time. The major concern for Covid was pressure on the limited health services like beds and icus to be provided to people coming at a fatser rate in a short period of time. Covid has been found to be asymptomatic in most of the cases. Although the number of covid cases id decreasing day byday it is important to find the pattern in various geographical, demographic and epidemiological factors which were associated with the most of the hospitlisations.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Find the predictors for the COVID hospitlisation in US based on geographical, demographic and epidemiological factors to build a model to predict the need for hospitilisation in a patient.

STAKEHOLDERS:
Doctors and medical professionals may be able to triage various patients according to presence and absence of predictors.

Health Organisations and Government Bodies: it can help them to better facilitate the medical supplies and vaccination drives to the Geographic areas and the suseptible population groups based on socio economic status , ethinicity, race etc.

Pharmaceutical companies and other medical device companies (mask, icu) can market their covid products more in the areas of need.

Small and local Businesses can manage and take proper decisions based on the trend in increase or decrease in covid cases in their geographical area.

General Population- Information about the covid incidence as well as risk of hospitlisation may help general population take necessary measures in time of need and also otherwise.
